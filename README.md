## Mission Statement

> [!NOTE]  
> What is the purpose of your project? (approx 100-200 words). Example below.


Fur Future Funding is a directory where organisations can list scholarship opportunities specifically targeted to people from diverse or disadvantaged backgrounds. 
Consolidating all opportunities in the one directory benefits both the organisations and potential applicants, connecting the right people to the right opportunity at the right time.
Scholarship and training providers often have small budgets and limited reach. Fur Future Funding will help boost their profile and provide a no-cost option for advertising.
Potential applicants can view, sort and filter hundreds of opportunities to create individualised views, saving time and effort to allow more time to apply for potential opportunities.

### Nice To Haves

- TBC

## Technical Implementation

> [!NOTE]  
> What languages and frameworks will you be using? What kind of database will you be using? How will you deploy the website? Example Below.

### Back-End

- Django / DRF API
- Python

### Front-End

- React / JavaScript
- HTML/CSS

### Git & Deployment

- Heroku
- Netlify
- GitHub

This application's back-end will be deployed to Heroku. The front-end will be deployed separately to Netlify.
 
We will also use Insomnia to ensure API endpoints are working smoothly (we will utilise a local and deployed environment in Insomnia).

## Target Audience

> [!NOTE]  
> Who is the website for? (approx 100 words). Example below.

This website has two major target audiences: Organisations looking to list opportunities on the website and Potential applicants looking for scholarship opportunities.

### Organisations

Organisation administrators will use the website to create new opportunity listings on the site. The administrators will then be able to edit an opportunity to update the status of the opportunity e.g. change open or closing date. 
TBC if we get profile created

### Potential applicants

General public will use this website to view scholarships opportunities that might be available to them. Potential applicants will not need to log in to view, sort and filter potential opportunities.
TBC if we get profile created
